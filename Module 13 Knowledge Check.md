# Module 13 Knowledge Check

### Which of the following are factors for calculating operational availability?

- [X] Level of downtime risk
- [ ] Component failure risk
- [X] Knowledge of the operational needs
- [ ] Grade of operational reliability
- [ ] Quality level
- [X] Design decisions of a data center

### How is mean time between failures (MTBF) calculated?

- [ ] MTBF = ∑ (beginning of downtime - end of uptime)/(total number of failures)
- [X] MTBF = ∑ (beginning of downtime - beginning of uptime)/(total number of failures)
- [ ] MTBF = ∑ (beginning of uptime - beginning of uptime)/(total number of failures)
- [ ] MTBF = ∑ (beginning of downtime - beginning of uptime)/(total amount of downtime)

### An uninterriptible power supply (UPS) inverter commonly fails. What is said to have because it does not perform its intended purpose?

- [ ] Low availability
- [ ] Low maintainability
- [X] Low reliability
- [ ] Low usability

### Which of the following provides a more accurate measure of a data center's performance, particularly for critical data center systems?

- [ ] Reliability
- [ ] Maintainability
- [X] Availability
- [ ] Dependability

### Which of the following equations calculates availability?

- [X] (MTBF) ÷ (MTBF + MTTR)
- [ ] e ^ (-t ÷ MTBF)
- [ ] MTBF + MTTR
- [ ] (MTTR) ÷ (MTBF - MTTR)

### Which of the following can cause power failures that result in unavailability in a data center? (Select TWO.)

- [X] Exhausted fuel in the backup generator
- [X] Nonfunctional batteries
- [ ] Impropper configuration of the failover cluster of servers
