# Module 5 Knowledge Check

### After power reaches a data center, which methods can you use to provide that power to the racks? (Select Three.)

- [X] Power distribution units (PDUs)
- [X] Distribution panel boards
- [ ] Generators
- [X] Busyways
- [ ] Automatic transfer switches (ATSs)
- [ ] Uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs)

### Which component obtains power from the main utility service provider and distributes it to various circuits in a data center?

- [X] Main electrical service panel
- [ ] Feeders
- [ ] Transformers
- [ ] Receptacles

### Which features characterize a transformer? (Select THREE.)

- [X] The input and output power (watts) are almost the same.
- [ ] There is a large amount of energy loss.
- [X] The voltage and current can be increased or decreased.
- [X] The input and output voltages have the same frequency.
- [ ] Windage and friction losses can occur because of the moving parts.
- [ ] The core always decreases the magnetic field of the current passing through the winding.

### What is the winding connected to the voltage that will be converted called?

- [ ] Secondary winding
- [X] Primary winding
- [ ] Local winding
- [ ] Tertiary winding

### Which features characterize step-down transformers? (Select TWO.)

- [X] The primary coil has more windings.
- [ ] They decrease the current from high to low.
- [X] They decrease the voltage levels
- [ ] They create a higher secondary voltage.
- [ ] They increase the voltage levels.

### Which secondary backup strategies can you implement to avoid disruption to power in data centers? (Select TWO.) 

- [X] Keeping a backup generator in addition to primary generator and uninterruptible power supply (UPS)
- [X] Always having backup fuel to run the generators
- [ ] Disconnecting the generator and running the uninterruptible power supply (UPS)
- [ ] Removing the uninterruptible power supply (UPS) and running the generator
- [ ] Disconnecting the primary generator

### Which features characterize natural gas generators? (Select THREE.)

- [X] Do not require backup fuel storage
- [ ] Have tanks to store fuel
- [X] Obtain fuel through a gas pipeline
- [X] Have no regulations for use
- [ ] Can only be used if you apply specified environment safety standards
- [ ] Do not need automatic transfer switches (ATSs)

### What is the most commonly used battery in an uninterruptible power supply (UPS)?

- [ ] Nickel-cadmium
- [ ] Lithium-ion
- [X] Lead-acid
- [ ] Nickel-metal hydride

### Which power distribution unit (PDU) type provides network-grade power distribution and can locally monitor load levels and avoid potential overloads? 

- [X] Metered PDU
- [ ] Switched PDU
- [ ] Simple PDU
- [ ] Rack PDU

### Why is vertical the preferred orientation for power distribution units (PDUs)?

- [ ] Because this orientation can be used with open-frame racks
- [X] Because the distribution outlets are closer to the equipment they power, which is a more efficient use of space
- [ ] Because this orientation is compatible with a wider range of connector types
- [ ] Because horizontal mounts cannot be used with audio and video equipment

### What are some uses of power measurement data? (Select THREE.)

- [ ] To help avoid testing the original power allocation
- [X] To help IT personnel to reduce risks
- [X] To reduce the rack vulnerability during power shutdown in a peak load situation
- [X] To discover the presence of any stranded power
- [ ] To help individual devices take in the power supply
- [ ] To automatically transfer power from the utility provider to the data center

### Which tasks are included in preventive maintenace (PM)? (Select THREE.)

- [X] Regular software updates
- [ ] Internet Protocol (IP)-based closed-circuit television (CCTV) system installation
- [X] Replacement of weak parts
- [X] Thermal scanning of breaker panels
- [ ] Determining corporate average data center efficiency (CADE)
- [ ] Estimating data center infrastructure efficiency (DCiE)

### What are typical characteristics of an arc flash? (Select TWO.)

- [ ] It is capable of producing very low temperatures.
- [ ] It generally begins with a low hum, which gives you time to address the issue.
- [X] It can cause devastating injuries and fatalities.
- [X] It can cause severe damage to equipment.
- [ ] It cannot be prevented.

### What does OSHA stand for?

- [ ] Organizational Safety and Health Administration
- [ ] Occupational Safety and Health Account
- [X] Occupational Safety and Health Administration
- [ ] Organizational Safety and Health Account
